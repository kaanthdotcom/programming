Along with German language, what are few other things we must plan for?

0) If interested, apply for job seeker visa for Austria (I can tell you how to). Again, having German language is defintely a plus in Austria as well.
1) Applying Germany JSV via VFS
2) Preparing the checklist for JSV
3) Maintenance of funds of at lest 6.5 lakhs, not so urgent though.
4) Prepare a stunning online presence (LinkedIn profile + active GitHub repo + consistent HakerRank submissions + (setting up a CI))
5) Catching the pace of C++ evolution - C++17, C++20
6) Have a regular meetup on DSA, Problem Solving especially
7) Keep applying on LinkedIn, Stepstone.de. Most important, be prepared to recieve "sorry" responses. Just 1 of 80 is a +ve response I've received.
8) Maintaining a central store with "very very quality" books & videos

I can help you for 1 & 2, it is very easy anyway
